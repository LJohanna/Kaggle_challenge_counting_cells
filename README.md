The dataset was taken from Kaggle. You can see pictures of blood cells and the goal is to build a Deep Learning model to count them (we will use Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow). You extract labels from the data itself because it is split in two : pictures named #cell.png and pictures named #dots.png. You take the label from the picture #dots.png just by counting the non zero pixels and you build your model on 80% of the #cell.png pictures. You can see in the notebook that the model allows the loss function to significantly decrease during the training (the MSE computing the difference between the true labels and predicted labels).
